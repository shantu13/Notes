-> Setting up 'application infrastructure' is costly operation and it is time taking process.

-> Instead of we are purchasing and setting up infrastructure we can take the help of Cloud Providers.

-> Cloud Providers are available in the market to provide infrastructure for rent on 'Pay As You Go' Model.

    (Note: Use services and pay the money for use)

      Ex: Credit cards, post paid bills etc...


Example : When we have function in our house we are not going to purchase chairs and tables. We will take them for rent and will use for our function. After the function we will return that material to the owner and will pay rent amount for usage.

-> Similary whatever the infrastructure (machines, servers, network, power, storage) required for our application we can take for rent instead of purchasing.

-> How much we use that much we need to pay for them (Pay As You Go Model)

-> AWS is one of the famous cloud provider available in the market which will provide IT infrastructure for Rent.
