What is Operating System ?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> Operating System is a software which is used to interact with computer

-> Operating System is acting as mediator between users and computer hardware components

-> Operating System is mandatory to use any computer

-> OS provides environment to run other applications

	(browser, notepad, paint, calc)

-> The OS came into market in 1950

-> Microsoft released it's first OS in 1981 (MS DOS)


+++++++++++++++
Windows OS
+++++++++++++++

-> Developed by Microsoft Company

-> It is having GUI (Graphical user interface)

-> It is single user based Operating System (only one person can use this at a time)

-> It is commercial (paid)

-> Less Security

-> It is recommended for personal use

			 - Watch Movies
			 - Using Internet
			 - Playing Games
			 - Attending Online classes
			 - Store data


+++++++++++++++
Linux OS
+++++++++++++++

-> Linux is Community Based OS

-> Linux is Free & Open Source OS

-> Linux is Multi User Based OS

-> High Security

-> Recommended to use for Applications, Servers, Databases etc..


Note: In realtime, we will use Linux OS only to setup infrastructure required to run our application


-> Linux OS is not only for Administrators, even developers and testers also will use Linux OS in realtime to monitor our application and application servers and application logs.

+++++++++++++++
History Of Linux
+++++++++++++++

-> In 1991, a student 'Linus Torvalds' developed this Linux OS

-> Linux Torvalds identified some challenges in UNIX OS and he suggested some changes 
  for Unix OS but UNIX OS Team rejected 'Linux Torvalds 'suggestions

-> Linus Torvalds used Minux OS to develop Linux 

		Linus + Minux 

-> First Two letters from his name and last 3 letters from Minux OS 

		LI + NUX => LINUX

-> Linus Torvalds released LINUX OS with source code into market so that anybody can modify LINUX OS thatys why it is called as Open Source Operating System.

-> As Linux OS is open source, so many people and companies taken that Linux OS and modified according to their requirements and released into market with different names those are called as Linux Distributions.


RHEL  -- RED HAT
Ubuntu OS
Cent OS
Fedora
Open SUSE
Kali Linux
Debian 
Amazon Linux

Note : 200+ Linux Distributions are available in the market.


+++++++++++++++
Environment Setup
+++++++++++++++

1) Create account in AWS (it will ask debit/credit card) - selected cards are accepted

2) Create Linux VM using AWS EC2 service (download key pair)

3) Download Mobaxterm software to connect with Linux VM

4) Connect with Linux VM using Public IP and pem file

Note: Once work is completed then stop your Linux VM in EC2 to avoid billing


+++++++++++++++
Linux Commands
+++++++++++++++

$ whoami : It will display currently logged in username

$ pwd : present working directory

$ date : To display current date

$ cal : To display calendar


-> In Linux everything  will be represented as a file

-> We have 3 types of files in linux

1) Ordinary File / Normal File  (it will start with -)
2) Directory File  (it will start with d)
3) Link File (it will start with l)

-> The file which contains data is called as ordinary file

-> Directory file is equal to folder (it can contain files and folders)

-> The file which is having linking is called as Link File 


=> touch : it is used to create empty file

		$ touch f1.txt
		$ touch f2.txt
		$ touch f3.txt f4.txt
	
=> To display files we will use 'ls' command

		$ ls

=> To create a file with data we will use 'cat' command

		$ cat > hello.txt
		//write data
		press CTRL + d (to save and exit)

		$ cat hello.txt   (To display file data)

		$ cat >> hello.txt (To append data in the file)
		//write data
		press CTRL + d (to save and exit)

-> To create directory we will use 'mkdir' command

		$ mkdir dirname

-> To remove the file we will use 'rm' command

		$ rm filename

-> To remove empty directory we will use 'rmdir' command

		$ rmdir dirname

=> 'ls' is used to list out all files & directories available in the given directory

Note: we can pass several options for 'ls' commands

-> ls : It will display all files in alphabetical order (a to z)

-> ls -r : It will display all files in reverse of alphabetical order (z to a)

-> ls -l : It will display long listing of files

-> ls -t : It will display all files based on last modified date and time. Most recent file will be display at top and old files will display at bottom.

-> ls -rt : It will display all files based on reverse of last modified date and time. Old files will display at top and recent files will display bottom.


-> ls -a : It will display all files including hidden files (hidden files will start with .)

-> ls -li : It will display files with inode.

-> ls -lR : It will display all files and directories along with sub directoris content

	Note: -R represents recursive

Note:  We can use several options for ls command at a time. When we are using multiple options order of the options is not important

		$ ls -ltr
		$ ls -tlr
		$ ls -l -t -r
		$ ls -trl

Note: All the above commands will give same output


-> To display content of given directory we can execute like below

		$ ls <dirname>

-> To delete a file we will use 'rm' command

		$ rm <filename>

-> To delete empty directory we will use 'rmdir' command

		$ rmdir dirname

-> To delete non-empty directory we will use 'rm' command like below

		$ rm -r dirname


-> To display file content we will use 'cat' command

		$ cat filename

-> To display file content with line numbers we will use '-n' option

		$ cat -n filename


-> To display multiple files content at a time execute command like below

		$ cat file1 file2 file3

-> Copy one file data into another file using 'cat' command

		$ cat f1.txt > f8.txt

-> Copy more than one file data into another file

		$ cat f1.txt f2.txt > f9.txt

Reversing File Content
----------------------
-> 'tac' command is used to reverse file content

	$ tac filename

-> 'rev' command is used to reverse each line content of the file

	$ rev filename


head command
-------------
-> head command is used to display file data from top (default 10 lines)

		$ head filename
		$ head -n 5 data.log  (first 5 lines data)
		~$ head -n 20 data.log (first 20 lines data)


tail command
-------------
-> tail command is used to display file data from bottom (default 10 lines)

		$ tail filename (last 10 lines data)
		$ tail -n 100 filename (last 100 lines data)
	
		$ tail +25 filename (it will display data from 25th line to bottom)
		

Note: To see on-growing logs we can use '-f' option

		$ tail -f data.log   (Live log message we can see)


wc command
-----------
-> It is used to count no.of lines, no.of words and no.of characters in the file

ubuntu@ip-172-31-47-242:~$ wc f1.txt
 2  8 45 f1.txt

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> When application running, it will generate log messages and it will store log messages at bottom of the file.


-> To see log messages of the application we will use 'tail' command


cp command
---------
-> To copy the data from one file to another file

	$ cp one.txt two.txt  ( or ) $ cat one.txt > two.txt

	$ cp f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt  (invalid syntax)

-> We can't copy morethan one file data using 'cp' command. To copy multiple files data we should go for 'cat' command

	$ cat f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt

Rename the files or directories
--------------------------------
-> To rename files we will use 'mv' command

	$ mv f1.txt f1111.txt

	$ mv  dirname dirnewname

Note: We can use 'mv' command for renaming and moving files

Comparing files
---------------
-> To compare files we can use below commands

$ cmp f1.txt f2.txt
$ diff f1.txt f2.txt

-> cmp command will display only first difference in given 2 two files
-> diff command will display all the differences in the content

grep command
------------
-> 'grep' stands for global regular expression print.

-> 'grep' command will process the text line by line and prints any lines which matches given pattern.

	Ex: I want to print all lines which contains 'NullPointerException'

	$ grep -i 'NullPointerException' *

Note: We can install grep using below command

	$ sudo yum install grep

//search for the lines which contains given word in the given filename
$ grep 'word' filename

//search for the lines which are having exception keyword in server.log file
$ grep -i 'exception' server.log 

//search for the given text in present directory and in sub-directories also
$ grep -R 'exception'

=> We can pass several options for 'grep' command

-c : This prints only the count of files that matches give pattern

-i : ignore case-sentitivty

-n : Display the matched lines and their line numbers

-l : Displays only file names that matches the pattern

-h : Displays matched lines without file names

-R : Displays matched lines with file names
