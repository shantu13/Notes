Dynamo DB
###########

-> Databases we can classify into 2 types

1) SQL Databases (Relational Databases)

2) No-SQL Databases


-> SQL databases are used to store the data which is having fixed structure
-> SQL databases will represent data in table format with rows & columns
-> The data structure is fixed here (no.of columns are fixed in table)
-> Data will have relationships

	Ex: Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, PostGreSQL etc.......

-> To work with Relational Databases we have "RDS" service in the AWS

-> RDS is fully managed service in "AWS"


-> No-SQL means Not Only SQL
-> No-SQL databases are used to deal with semi-structured & un-structured data
-> In No-SQL databases the structure of the data is not fixed

  Ex :  Dynamo DB, Mongo DB, Hive, Cassandra etc....

-> Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service that supports keyâ€“value and document data structures and is offered by Amazon.com
