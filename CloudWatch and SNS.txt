->  Application and Infrastructure Monitoring service

-> Amazon CloudWatch is a component of Amazon Web Services that provides monitoring for AWS resources and the customer applications running on the Amazon infrastructure.

-> CloudWatch enables real-time monitoring of AWS resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances. 

-> The application automatically collects and provides metrics for CPU utilization, latency and request counts. 

-> Users can also stipulate additional metrics to be monitored, such as memory usage, transaction volumes or error rate.
